        I am a Front-End Web Developer with one year of experience. My interest
        in front-end development began with a strong desire to design and
        deliver stunning, beautiful, and user-friendly interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with hands-on experience
        in the React library. I am also proficient in utilizing CSS frameworks
        such as Bootstrap and Tailwind to build responsive and modern web
        designs. In addition, although my primary focus is on front-end
        development, I have practical experience working with Firebase as a
        backend solution.
